# Wordle Global

[wordle.global](https://wordle.global/)

Open Source Wordle in a bunch of languages

PULL REQUESTS WELCOME!

It would be mega awesome if you could help in any way (especially with language addition/curation).

contact: wordle@hugo0.com

**How to add a new language:**
1. Make a folder in webapp/data/languages/ with the language code (e.g. en, de, fr, qya, etc.)
2. Add a list of 5-letter words and call it {lang_code}_5words.txt
    1. (Optional) Add a language_config.json file
    2. (Optional) Add a keyboard configuration 
    3. (Optional) Add a list of supplemental words (useful to have this for weird/rare words, and only have 'common' words in the main 5words.txt file)

Voilà!

## How to run locally

If you want to test out your changes, you can run the server locally.

1. Install Python 3

2. Install requirements
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

3. Run web server locally
```gunicorn --chdir webapp app:app```

4. Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

## TODOs
- [ ] take into account browser bar height on mobile
- [ ] curate wordlists for existing languages
- [ ] add keyboard layouts for existing languages
- [ ] add more languages
- [ ] fully translate game interface (missing score streaks and options)

Potential improvements:
- [ ] nice animations for revealing letters & such
- [ ] make a 4, 6, 7 letter version
- [ ] deal with accents & character modifiers better (e.g. french is horrible right now)

Nice to haves:
- [ ] improve code quality (e.g. make variable names consistent, code more reusable & less hacky)
- [ ] properly integrate TailwindCSS and Vue.js (i.e. not from CDN)
- [ ] tests...
